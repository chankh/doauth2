# doauth2

### Description

A Dart OAuth2 library for client-side (implicit) flow. A simple port from Andreas Ã…kre Solberg's JSO library (https://github.com/andreassolberg/jso)

### Features

* Implements OAuth2 Implicit Flow.
* Supports the `bearer` access token type.
* No server component needed.
* Can handle multiple providers at once.
* Uses *HTML 5.0 localStorage* to cache Access Tokens. You do not need to implement a storage.

### Usage/Installation

Add this dependency to your pubspec.yaml

```
  dependencies:
    doauth2: any
```

### Web applications

Import the library in your dart application

```
  import "package:doauth2/doauth2.dart" as doauth2;
```

Initialize the OAuth2 provider configuration with your parameters

```
String clientId = '<your-client-id>';
String redirectUri = '<your-redirect-uri>';
String authorization = '<your-authorization-endpoint-uri>';
doauth2.Config c = new doauth2.Config(clientId, redirectUri, authorization);
doauth2.configure({'provider1': c});
```

Once your have configured a provider, you can use the `auth` method to send the authentication request.

```
doauth2.auth({'oauth_provider': 'provider1', 'oauth_allowia' : true, 'oauth_scopes': ['read', 'write']});
```

When you have received an access token, it will be stored in the local storage automatically.
